Write JavaScript code for a NodeJs application.
The application is a command line tool that accepts one required command line parameter - the path to a file.

Here is the algorithm of the application:

- Read the content of the file into a string. The file is in UTF-8 encoding.
- Call the function drakonToPrompt(content, filename). Send the content and the full path to that function. The function will return a string.
- Write the string to disc in UTF-8 encoding. The filename is like the path to the file from the command line,
but replace its extension to .txt

Use await for async operations.
Import drakonToPrompt function from ./drakonToPrompt

The format of application is CommonJs.
If there is an uncaught exception, print both the message and the stacktrace.

If the application has completed its task without errors, do not print anything in the console.
